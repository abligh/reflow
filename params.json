{"tagline":"Reflow mail messages","body":"### Reflow\r\n\r\n'reflow' reformats mail messages sensibly. It works as a UNIX pipe, reformatting STDIN to STDOUT, rather like the `fmt` command. However, it's designed to intelligently process text, particularly mail messages, and deal with quoting and indentation.\r\n\r\nIt can be used at the command line, wired up to any editor, or (on OS-X) to Automator and Services to reflow any editable window on a keypress.\r\n\r\n    Usage: reflow [options] < INFILE > OUTFILE\r\n    \r\n    Options:\r\n      -w, --width N               Set width to N (default 76)\r\n      -s, --strip-signature       Strip email signatures\r\n      -q, --quote N               Increase quotation level by N, or\r\n                                  decrease quotation level by -N\r\n      -i, --indent N              Increase indent level by 4N, or\r\n                                  decrease indent level by -4N\r\n      -m, --max-quote N           Maximum quotation level of N\r\n                                  (default 10)\r\n      -y, --min-width N           Minimum text width of N\r\n                                  (default 20)\r\n      -h, --help                  Print this message\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
